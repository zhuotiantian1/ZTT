### Image Upload

1. Install PicGo.
2. Create a new image repository on GitHub.
3. Access the image bed settings.
4. Obtain the key.
5. Set the custom domain to use CDN acceleration. For example, `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/username/repository`, complete the PicGo setup.

7. Then drag the picture to the upload area, check if it is uploaded successfully in the album, and you can also copy the picture path.

(ps. If PicGo configuration keeps failing, you can directly create a folder named "images" in your GitHub repository and add files to it.)

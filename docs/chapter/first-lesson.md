<h2 style="color: #e19cab;">Graphene：</h2>
Graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice.   It is known for its exceptional strength (around 200 times stronger than steel), conductivity (both electrical and thermal), and flexibility.

Applications：Graphene has applications in various fields such as electronics (flexible displays, transistors), energy storage (super-capacitors, batteries), biomedical devices (biosensors, drug delivery systems), and even in composite materials for enhancing mechanical properties.

<h2 style="color: #e19cab;">Metamaterials：</h2>
Metamaterials are man-made materials whose structure and properties are designed beyond the limitations of natural materials, often precisely controlling the structure of the material on a microscopic scale. They are unique in that the size of their building units is much smaller than the wavelength of light or sound, allowing them to exhibit completely different electromagnetic, acoustic or thermal properties than natural materials.

Applications**: Metamaterials are being explored for applications such as cloaking devices (to manipulate electromagnetic waves), antennas (to achieve higher efficiency and directional control), lenses (for improved resolution and focusing capabilities), and even in acoustic and mechanical metamaterials for controlling sound and vibration

<h2 style="color: #e19cab;"> 1.Titanium alloy: Heat treatment</h2>
The titanium alloy parts are treated with solid solution and heated to the alloy solid solution temperature to dissolve the solid solution in the alloy. This is followed by rapid cooling (quenching) to maintain a uniform distribution of the solid solution, followed by aging treatment to keep the material at a lower temperature for a certain time, so that the precipitation appears around the grain boundaries and dislocations to enhance the strength and hardness of the material.

<h1 style="color: #e19cab;">2.ABS plastic: spray coating</h2>
First, prepare the ABS plastic surface to ensure that it is clean and dust-free. Then, use a suitable primer for the ABS plastic surface to enhance the adhesion of the paint film. The desired color of paint is then sprayed to ensure uniform coverage of the entire surface. Finally, proper drying and curing is carried out to ensure that the coating is strong and durable. This treatment not only improves the appearance quality of ABS plastic, but also enhances its durability, which is suitable for a variety of application scenarios, such as automotive parts, furniture and electronic product housings.

<h2 style="color: #e19cab;">3.Wood: Sanding</h2>
First, choose the appropriate thickness of sandpaper, usually ranging from a thicker 40 to a finer 400, depending on the type of wood and the desired smoothness. Use a manual sanding tool such as sandpaper, grinding wheel or sander, or an electric sander, as needed. In the sanding process, apply pressure evenly and gently, sanding along the direction of the wood grain to avoid leaving marks or scratches. After finishing sanding, check the surface of the wood to ensure the desired smoothness and texture. This step is very important because it lays a good foundation for subsequent woodworking projects or decorative work.

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">2.To adjust the focus:</h3>
Make sure the focus of the laser head is properly adjusted to the acrylic surface. Typically, the focus is a few millimeters above the surface of the material, which ensures the best cutting results.

<h2 style="color: #e19cab;">Wood：</h2>
<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">1. Preparation:</h3>
· Ensure that the laser cutting machine is properly installed, calibrated and in good working order.
· Prepare wood suitable for laser cutting, such as sheet wood, plywood or medium density fiberboard (MDF). Make sure the surface of the wood is flat and free of scratches or dirt.
Use vector graphics software (such as Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW, etc.) to create or import design files that need to be cut.
· Ensure that the design document is accurate and correctly placed in the working area of the laser cutting machine.
<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">2. Set cutting parameters:</h3>
Depending on the type and thickness of wood used, set cutting parameters including power, speed and depth of focus. (Typically, wood cutting requires high power and moderate to fast cutting speeds to ensure clear cutting edges without burning or melting the wood)

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">3. Adjust focus:</h3>
Make sure the focus of the laser head is properly adjusted to the wood surface. In general, the focus should be located a few millimeters above the surface of the material to get the best cutting results.

<h2 style="color: #e19cab;">Acrylic：</h2>
<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">1. Preparation:</h3>
· Material selection: Choose stable quality paper or cardboard, avoid using too thin or flammable materials.
· Prepare paper or board material suitable for laser cutting, ensuring that the surface is flat and free of creases or dirt.
· Cutting parameters adjustment: According to the thickness and type of paper or cardboard, adjust the cutting parameters to obtain the best cutting effect and avoid excessive burning or cutting of the material.
· Ensure that the operating area is well ventilated to remove fumes and gases generated during cutting.
Use proper personal protective equipment (PPE), such as safety glasses, to protect your eyes from laser radiation and paper scraps.

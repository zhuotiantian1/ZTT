<h2 style="color: #e19cab;">3. Post processing for metal、plastic、wood</h2>

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;"> 1.Titanium alloy: Heat treatment</h3>

The heat treatment of titanium alloys is an important process aimed at improving their mechanical properties, corrosion resistance and other properties by controlling the microstructure and properties of the alloys. 

<h4 style="color: #e19cab;">1. Solution Treatment</h4>

Solid solution treatment is one of the most common heat treatment methods of titanium alloy, the main purpose is to dissolve the solid solution in the alloy, eliminate the solid solution precipitated phase in the alloy, so that it can achieve a uniform solid solution state. 

![Pigo](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zhuotiantian1/Mary/img/fe8cca8292036e8117ca1dfe5bae3d26.jpeg)

·Heating: The titanium alloy is heated to the solution temperature, usually the β phase temperature range of the alloy. Different kinds of titanium alloys, the solution temperature and time will be different, generally between 700°C and 1000°C.

·Heat preservation: Maintain a certain time at the solution temperature so that the alloying elements in the solid solution are fully dissolved and evenly distributed in the matrix.

·Cooling: Quickly cooled to room temperature, can be used air cooling or water cooling. Rapid cooling can effectively prevent excessive precipitated phase from solid solution.

After solution treatment, the strength and plasticity of the titanium alloy will be improved, and the residual stress of the alloy will be reduced.

<h4 style="color: #e19cab;">2. Quenching</h4>

The titanium alloy after solution treatment is quickly cooled to below room temperature. The speed of quenching and the choice of medium will affect the microstructure of titanium alloys, and the media usually used include water, oil or air.
Quenching treatment can increase the hardness and strength of titanium alloys, but it may also lead to the deformation of some alloy parts or the increase of internal stress, so it needs to be carefully considered when choosing the quenching process.

<h4 style="color: #e19cab;">3. Aging Treatment</h4>

Reheating the alloy after solution treatment and possible quenching to a lower temperature, usually between 250°C and 500°C, for a period of time before cooling.Tempering helps to form the desired precipitated phase in the alloy, improving the strength, corrosion resistance and heat resistance of the alloy. The choice of tempering time and temperature depends on the specific composition of the alloy and the required properties.

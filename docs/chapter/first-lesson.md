- With the progress of The Times, nowadays young people, especially college students, live under various pressures. They not only have to face the pressure of their studies and attend various training, but also prepare for internships and job hunting. The pressure of life is also difficult to ignore, they have to learn to live independently, adjust interpersonal relationships, and even bear the pressure of life brought by rising prices. In addition, they may also suffer from relationship stress when it comes to intimacy. When it comes to personal image, they may also face face and body pressure, as visual social media and mass media are filled with the pursuit of the perfect body and face. In this environment, they desperately need a way to spread the pressure. This is what we wanted to create, an interactive art installation designed to relieve their inner stress and anxiety and help them find inner peace, thereby preventing and promoting their mental health.

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">Project addresses problem points</h3>
1.Relieve student pressure
In a stressful school environment with final exams, our interactive installation provides students with an opportunity to relax and release stress through musical engagement and interactive experiences. Singing as a way of emotional release can help students relieve anxiety and tension.
2. Improve students' mental health
Rotating streamers and flashing lights in the interactive installation create a pleasant and comfortable environment. This innovative interactive approach is more than just a technical demonstration, it provides students with a positive physical and mental health experience.
3.Enhance student engagement and well-being
Through innovative and interactive ways, students are encouraged to participate and deepen their awareness and emphasis on a healthy lifestyle while releasing stress.

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">Target group identification</h3>
The target group we choose is college students in the final week. According to our survey, students in the final week usually have increased time pressure, tight schedule, irregular work and rest time, big mood swings, unhealthy diet, affected health and other negative effects, which is ultimately due to excessive academic pressure caused by a large number of things to be completed in the final week.

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">Characteristics of target group</h3>
1.Lonely and helpless: Although many students review with their classmates, some students may feel lonely because everyone's learning content and pace are different.

2.Feeling insecure: Some students may have self-doubt and worry that they will not be able to cope with the exam, showing unease and lack of confidence.

3.Exhaustion: Long periods of intensive review and irregular work and rest can lead to a feeling of mental exhaustion, feeling physically and mentally exhausted.

4.Nervous anxiety: As the exam is approaching, many students feel nervous and anxious, worrying about whether their review is sufficient and whether they can get good grades in the exam.

5.Less social: Students will reduce social activities, spend more time revising, and may temporarily reduce communication with friends and family.

6.Stress response: In the face of test stress, some students may show stress reactions, such as mood swings, irritability, and even physical reactions such as headache or stomach pain before the test.

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">Simulation scenario assumption</h3>
 After discussion, we set the scene simulation in the week before the final exam of the school, and held a campus garden party to release the pressure of students to review the exam. In the garden party, there were small games and related exhibitions. Our installation was set up in the exhibition, an interactive device to release pressure and relax the body and mind.

<h4 style="color: #e19cab;">2. Physical characteristics</h4>

1.Light and high strength: The density of titanium alloys is about half that of steel, but the strength is close to that of some high-strength steels. This makes titanium alloys an ideal material choice in the aerospace and automotive industries.

2.Corrosion resistance: Titanium alloy has good corrosion resistance, especially the corrosion resistance of seawater and chloride and other media is very superior, so it is widely used in Marine engineering and chemical equipment manufacturing.

3.High temperature resistance: Titanium alloys still maintain good mechanical properties at high temperatures, so they are widely used in aerospace and aircraft engines.

4.Disadvantages: However, titanium alloys are difficult to process and therefore more expensive.  In addition, if the parameters are not set properly, pores may appear, which will affect the performance of the part.

### ABS plastic

<h4 style="color: #e19cab;">1. Composition and structure</h4>

ABS plastic derives its name from the initials of its three main components: Acrylonitrile (Styrene), Butadiene (Butadiene) and Styrene (Styrene). These ingredients are mixed in different proportions to form ABS plastics, which typically contain 20% to 30% acrylonitrile, 5% to 30% butadiene, and 40% to 60% styrene.

 <div><img width="1000" src="https://github.com/NexMaker-Fab/2024ZWU-IS-8-BUNBUN/raw/f2d2c2549cb8b9eb328d11f1cecf9514875af4a5/images/material/asb.jpeg"></div>

<h4 style="color: #e19cab;">2. Physical characteristics</h4>

### Carbon fiber composite

<h4 style="color: #e19cab;">1. Composition and structure</h4>

·Carbon fiber: Carbon fiber is a thin fiber composed of carbon elements, with extremely high strength and stiffness. Carbon fiber usually exists in the form of silk or yarn, which can be woven into cloth or yarn and used to enhance the mechanical properties of materials.

·Resin matrix: A resin matrix is a polymer (usually an epoxy resin or a polyamide resin) that is used to secure and protect the carbon fiber and give it an overall structure. The resin matrix is impregnated with carbon fiber and cured to form a composite material.

<h4 style="color: #e19cab;">Common processing methods</h4>

### Titanium alloy

Titanium alloys need to improve their mechanical properties and plasticity through various heat treatment and cold working methods. Common treatment methods include quenching, tempering, aging treatment, annealing and various cold processing such as rolling, stretching, bending and so on. Since titanium alloys are highly sensitive to process conditions, it is important to control process parameters.

 <div><img width="1000" src="https://github.com/NexMaker-Fab/2024ZWU-IS-8-BUNBUN/raw/4453e9 934a22854ed7efab2a31b816aaae50e426/images/material/%E6%B7%AC%E7%81%AB%E5%9B%9E%E7%81%AB.jpeg"></div>

### ABS plastic

The treatment of ABS plastics mainly includes injection molding, extrusion, blow molding, thermoforming and so on. Further, it may involve grinding, cutting, painting, coating, etc. During the treatment process, special attention needs to be paid to the thermal and chemical stability of ABS to prevent excessive melting and degradation.

 <div><img width="1000" src="https://github.com/NexMaker-Fab/2024ZWU-IS-8-BUNBUN/raw/4453e9934a22854ed7efab2a31b816aaae50e426/images/material/%E5%90%B9%E5%A1%91.gif"></div>

### Carbon fiber composite

The processing of carbon fiber composites includes cutting, laying, curing, cutting/milling and other steps. Due to the orientation of the structure, it is necessary to pay attention to the orientation and layup of the fibers during the treatment process. In addition, the cutting and processing of this material may produce dust, so reasonable environmental control and protection measures are required.

 <div><img width="1000" src="https://github.com/NexMaker-Fab/2024ZWU-IS-8-BUNBUN/raw/4453e9934a22854ed7efab2a31b816aaae50e426/images/material/%E9%93%BA%E5%B1%82.jpeg"></div>

<h2 style="color: #e19cab;">3. Post processing for metal、plastic、wood</h2>

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;"> 1.Titanium alloy: Heat treatment</h3>
The titanium alloy parts are treated with solid solution and heated to the alloy solid solution temperature to dissolve the solid solution in the alloy. This is followed by rapid cooling (quenching) to maintain a uniform distribution of the solid solution, followed by aging treatment to keep the material at a lower temperature for a certain time, so that the precipitation appears around the grain boundaries and dislocations to enhance the strength and hardness of the material.

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">2.ABS plastic: spray coating</h3>
First, prepare the ABS plastic surface to ensure that it is clean and dust-free. Then, use a suitable primer for the ABS plastic surface to enhance the adhesion of the paint film. The desired color of paint is then sprayed to ensure uniform coverage of the entire surface. Finally, proper drying and curing is carried out to ensure that the coating is strong and durable. This treatment not only improves the appearance quality of ABS plastic, but also enhances its durability, which is suitable for a variety of application scenarios, such as automotive parts, furniture and electronic product housings.

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">3.Wood: Sanding</h3>
First, choose the appropriate thickness of sandpaper, usually ranging from a thicker 40 to a finer 400, depending on the type of wood and the desired smoothness. Use a manual sanding tool such as sandpaper, grinding wheel or sander, or an electric sander, as needed. In the sanding process, apply pressure evenly and gently, sanding along the direction of the wood grain to avoid leaving marks or scratches. After finishing sanding, check the surface of the wood to ensure the desired smoothness and texture. This step is very important because it lays a good foundation for subsequent woodworking projects or decorative work.

- **Specification:**

2×0.3 square; Length 10m (Wire core material: Tin-plated copper)

- Tin-plated copper wire is made by plating a layer of tin on the surface of the copper wire. This material combines the advantages of copper and tin and has excellent electrical conductivity. The tin layer on its surface can prevent the copper wire from contacting the air, thus preventing oxidation. This makes the life of tin-plated copper wire longer and the performance more stable. And tin is a very stable metal, not easily corroded by acid or alkali. Therefore, tin-plated copper wire has good corrosion resistance in various environments. The tin layer can also improve the welding performance of the copper wire, making welding easier and the connection more solid. At the same time, due to the protection of the tin layer, the tin-plated copper wire can maintain good performance in high temperature, humidity or other harsh environments, thereby extending its service life. 

**Therefore, using pure copper wires can better ensure the safe connection of the entire circuit.**

<h2 style="color: #e19cab;">1. Introduction to basic materials (metal, plastic, composite)</h2>

### Titanium alloy

- Advantages: Titanium alloy is a very attractive metal with high strength, light weight, good heat resistance and high resistance to corrosion. Its complex structural design is ideal for human implants or lightweight, high-strength aircraft parts.

- Disadvantages: However, titanium alloys are difficult to process and therefore more expensive. In addition, if the parameters are not set properly, pores may appear, which will affect the performance of the part.

### ABS plastic

- Advantages: ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene) plastic is a thermoplastic polymer often used to create personalized toys, models or prototypes. Its advantages are high temperature resistance, high strength and good toughness, which makes ABS material have good plasticity after dissolution and curing.

- Disadvantages: However, ABS is prone to deformation during use. At the same time, it also emits a pungent smell, so it needs to be used in a well-ventilated environment. ABS materials are also sensitive to ambient temperature and humidity.

### Carbon fiber composite

- Advantages: Carbon fiber composites consist of carbon fiber and resin (usually epoxy resin). This material combines the high stiffness, high tensile strength and low weight of carbon fiber with the plasticity and robustness of resin. As a result, carbon fiber composites are light and strong, making them ideal for high-performance applications.

- Disadvantages: However, the strength and hardness of carbon fiber can cause wear and tear on the equipment and may require more advanced equipment configurations. In addition, controlling the properties and post-processing of composites is also relatively complex.

<h4 style="color: #e19cab;">Common processing methods</h4>

### Titanium alloy

Titanium alloys need to improve their mechanical properties and plasticity through various heat treatment and cold working methods. Common treatment methods include quenching, tempering, aging treatment, annealing and various cold processing such as rolling, stretching, bending and so on. Since titanium alloys are highly sensitive to process conditions, it is important to control process parameters.

### ABS plastic

The treatment of ABS plastics mainly includes injection molding, extrusion, blow molding, thermoforming and so on. Further, it may involve grinding, cutting, painting, coating, etc. During the treatment process, special attention needs to be paid to the thermal and chemical stability of ABS to prevent excessive melting and degradation.

 <div><img width="1000" src="https://github.com/NexMaker-Fab/2024ZWU-IS-8-BUNBUN/raw/4453e9934a22854ed7efab2a31b816aaae50e426/images/material/%E5%90%B9%E5%A1%91.gif"></div>

### Carbon fiber composite

The processing of carbon fiber composites includes cutting, laying, curing, cutting/milling and other steps. Due to the orientation of the structure, it is necessary to pay attention to the orientation and layup of the fibers during the treatment process. In addition, the cutting and processing of this material may produce dust, so reasonable environmental control and protection measures are required.

 <h2 style="color: #e19cab;">2. Two new materials</h2>
<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">Graphene：</h3>
Graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice.   It is known for its exceptional strength (around 200 times stronger than steel), conductivity (both electrical and thermal), and flexibility.

![PIGO](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zhuotiantian1/Mary/img/a4b75b04fdd3677bd84941a450e9831e.jpeg)

Applications：Graphene has applications in various fields such as electronics (flexible displays, transistors), energy storage (super-capacitors, batteries), biomedical devices (biosensors, drug delivery systems), and even in composite materials for enhancing mechanical properties.

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">Metamaterials：</h3>
Metamaterials are man-made materials whose structure and properties are designed beyond the limitations of natural materials, often precisely controlling the structure of the material on a microscopic scale. They are unique in that the size of their building units is much smaller than the wavelength of light or sound, allowing them to exhibit completely different electromagnetic, acoustic or thermal properties than natural materials.

Applications**: Metamaterials are being explored for applications such as cloaking devices (to manipulate electromagnetic waves), antennas (to achieve higher efficiency and directional control), lenses (for improved resolution and focusing capabilities), and even in acoustic and mechanical metamaterials for controlling sound and vibration

<h2 style="color: #e19cab;">3. Post processing for metal、plastic、wood</h2>

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;"> 1.Titanium alloy: Heat treatment</h3>
The titanium alloy parts are treated with solid solution and heated to the alloy solid solution temperature to dissolve the solid solution in the alloy. This is followed by rapid cooling (quenching) to maintain a uniform distribution of the solid solution, followed by aging treatment to keep the material at a lower temperature for a certain time, so that the precipitation appears around the grain boundaries and dislocations to enhance the strength and hardness of the material.

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">2.ABS plastic: spray coating</h3>
First, prepare the ABS plastic surface to ensure that it is clean and dust-free. Then, use a suitable primer for the ABS plastic surface to enhance the adhesion of the paint film. The desired color of paint is then sprayed to ensure uniform coverage of the entire surface. Finally, proper drying and curing is carried out to ensure that the coating is strong and durable. This treatment not only improves the appearance quality of ABS plastic, but also enhances its durability, which is suitable for a variety of application scenarios, such as automotive parts, furniture and electronic product housings.

<h3 style="color: #e19cab;">3.Wood: Sanding</h3>
First, choose the appropriate thickness of sandpaper, usually ranging from a thicker 40 to a finer 400, depending on the type of wood and the desired smoothness. Use a manual sanding tool such as sandpaper, grinding wheel or sander, or an electric sander, as needed. In the sanding process, apply pressure evenly and gently, sanding along the direction of the wood grain to avoid leaving marks or scratches. After finishing sanding, check the surface of the wood to ensure the desired smoothness and texture. This step is very important because it lays a good foundation for subsequent woodworking projects or decorative work.

### <font size="3"><h3 style="color: #e19cab;">3.Pure Copper Transparent Electric Wire:</h3></font>

- **Specification:**

2×0.3 square; Length 10m (Wire core material: Tin-plated copper)

- Tin-plated copper wire is made by plating a layer of tin on the surface of the copper wire. This material combines the advantages of copper and tin and has excellent electrical conductivity. The tin layer on its surface can prevent the copper wire from contacting the air, thus preventing oxidation. This makes the life of tin-plated copper wire longer and the performance more stable. And tin is a very stable metal, not easily corroded by acid or alkali. Therefore, tin-plated copper wire has good corrosion resistance in various environments. The tin layer can also improve the welding performance of the copper wire, making welding easier and the connection more solid. At the same time, due to the protection of the tin layer, the tin-plated copper wire can maintain good performance in high temperature, humidity or other harsh environments, thereby extending its service life. 

**Therefore, using pure copper wires can better ensure the safe connection of the entire circuit.**

- Cold-rolled steel is a type of steel processed by cold rolling. Compared with hot-rolled steel, cold-rolled steel plate has more precise thickness and smoother and more beautiful surface. The cold rolling process increases the hardness of the steel, improves its strength, while reducing its toughness and plasticity. Under this process, cold-rolled steel can be formed by various cold rolling shape machines, producing various complex shapes. However, because the cold rolling process is more complicated than the hot rolling process, the production cost is relatively higher, so the price of cold-rolled steel is usually higher than that of hot-rolled steel. Its good mechanical properties and process performance make it widely used in multiple fields such as automobiles, home appliances, construction, and mechanical manufacturing.

**Therefore, in this device, we use its smooth, low-resistance feature as a tool to drive the cloth to rotate.**
